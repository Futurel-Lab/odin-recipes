# odin-recipes

This project is intended to display some rather basic HTML skills. It will contain a simple webpage that links to a few different food recipes.
As I progress through the project I may share some more of my thoughts and any problems I may have run in to.

## Beginning Stages
Following the basic curriculum, it instructs you to make a simple site with a few pages listing and linking to various recipes that you want to add. I was successfully adding pages, images, and the recipes. I was committing along the way but was not paying attention to the messages in the console.

It turns out I had missed a step in VSCode that has you "stage" files before committing. So, as I committed files they were not actually committing.
When reviewing the project you may see a period of commits that are more ambiguous, these were a result of my troubleshooting the issue before finding out what had went wrong.

Afterwards, I learned to stage my changes, and continued adding recipes to the project.
