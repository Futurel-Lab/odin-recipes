    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Generously coat a large frying pan with cooking spray. Cook and stir chorizo in the prepared pan over medium-high heat until well browned and crumbled. Add onion and chile pepper; continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until onion is tender. </li>
        <li>Beat eggs in a medium bowl and add to chorizo mixture. Reduce heat to medium-low; continue cooking and stirring until eggs are scrambled and no longer runny. </li>
        <li>Warm flour tortillas in the microwave for 30 seconds. Spoon chorizo-egg mixture into the middle of each tortilla and top with shredded Cheddar cheese. Roll up like a burrito. </li>
